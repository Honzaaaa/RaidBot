# RaidBot

```
This is an discord.js raid bot i've created. 
If you'll get terminated or something, i am not responding for this, it's your problem.
```

# How to use

```
You must install Node.js, run cmd, and using cd command get into the folder and type: npm i, and wait until everything will be installed.
Next thing you have to do is put an bot token into config.json, and put your verification key to key.txt
```
